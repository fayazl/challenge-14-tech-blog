## For this challenge, we are using the Handlebars to build our application. By using conditionals, we are able to see if a user has logged in or logged out to perform a set of actions. 

## When a user visits the homepage without logging in, they will see a series of posts. Ince the log in they will have the opportunity to comment or create a new post by visiting the dashboard.

## When a user is logged in the navigation will change and give them the opportunity to log out.

## We are using MySQl2, Sequelize to house the database and express/handlebars to run our application. 

## By minially adding some bootstrap, we ahve a functioning application.
